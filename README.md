#GULLAK 
Gullak is a new age pocket money app for kids. In this app Parents can create Tasks and when the children do the job, a part of the pocket money gets credited to the account of the kid.

This app makes the kid do the job which he has been assigned to him. It increases the financial literacy of the kid. It initiates a feeling of responsibility in the child.
